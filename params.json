It contains several small, single-file, Python scripts which should lower the learning curve [[1]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08893). These examples depend only on standard Python and its scientific libraries [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org). Note that Python/NumPy are widely used, and are freely available for all operating systems; no custom software or libraries, housing hidden layers of complexity, are used.\r\n\r\nSince different approaches exists for this type of numerical method, and since there are many styles and programming languages, **anyone is invited to contribute** by:\r\n\r\n1. Uploading similar small, preferably single-file, examples for different materials, in different programming languages, or featuring different approaches.\r\n\r\n2. Updating this document with the state-of-the-art: an overview of which literature and what approaches are 'on the market'.\r\n\r\n# Available examples\r\n\r\n1. `finite-strain/hyper-elasticity.py` and `finite-strain/hyper-elasticity_even.py`: the main example of Ref.[[1]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08893) featuring a simple hyper-elastic model in finite strain. As described in Ref. [[1]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08893) the projection operator is slightly different for even or odd grids, here in included in two files. *Great to get started*.\r\n\r\n2. `finite-strain/elasto-plasticity.py` and `finite-strain/elasto-plasticity_even.py`: an extension of example 1 with the Simo elasto-plastic model for finite strain [[1]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08893). Furthermore, the definition of the projection operator is vectorized.\r\n\r\n3. `finite-strain/elasto-plasticity_2D-micrograph`: a realistic example to simulate the mechanical response of the 2-D micrograph of dual-phase steel [[1]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08893). Compared to example 2 this example deals with assuming 2-D plane strain.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n[1]: T.W.J. de Geus, J. Vond≈ôejc, J. Zeman, R.H.J. Peerlings, M.G.D. Geers.
